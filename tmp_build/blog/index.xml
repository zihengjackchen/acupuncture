Its first written mention was around 100 BCE, and many scholars believe it was used several centuries earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chinese medicine, health depends on the balance of yin and yang, qi (chee) and blood, and the functional harmony of organs and meridians. Imbalance is considered the root of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Does Acupuncture Hurt?</title><link>/blog/does-acupuncture-hurt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 09:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>/blog/does-acupuncture-hurt/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture needles are hair-thin filiform needles. They are different from the hollow syringes used for injections or blood draws, and insertion is virtually painless for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Points on the hands, feet, and face can occasionally be more sensitive, but this is usually brief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During treatment, some people feel sensations such as soreness, numbness, bloating, heaviness, warmth, coolness, or even brief itching. These sensations are often temporary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After needling, most people feel a deep sense of calm and relaxation. This is often when people notice the treatment beginning to work, and when acupuncture starts to heal.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How Much Does Mobile Acupuncture Cost?</title><link>/blog/how-much-does-mobile-acupuncture-cost/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 09:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>/blog/how-much-does-mobile-acupuncture-cost/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Our mobile services currently have a base commute rate of $29.99 for each commute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the more chronic the issue, the longer the treatment course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture works by restoring balance and supporting your body&amp;rsquo;s natural healing mechanisms, so it can take time to see clear results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical recommendation is about twice per week for severe pain, or weekly treatment for four to six weeks for many other concerns before judging whether acupuncture is helping.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What Can Acupuncture Treat?</title><link>/blog/what-can-acupuncture-treat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 09:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>/blog/what-can-acupuncture-treat/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The most common concerns patients visit us for include pain, anxiety, sinus congestion, insomnia, energy improvement, ear problems, digestion issues, fertility, IVF support, postpartum care, and menopause support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture can help reduce pain after injury, but it is wise to see a medical doctor first to rule out fractures and structural damage before beginning acupuncture treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What Are the Risks of Acupuncture?</title><link>/blog/what-are-the-risks-of-acupuncture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 09:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>/blog/what-are-the-risks-of-acupuncture/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Licensed acupuncturists receive thorough training in needling techniques and safety, so the risk of serious side effects is very small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common side effects are minor bleeding, mild bruising at the needle site, or occasional dizziness after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special caution is needed for people taking blood thinner medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electro-acupuncture may not be suitable for people with pacemakers. Acupuncture without electric stimulation is good enough to help those patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What Is Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)?</title><link>/blog/what-is-traditional-chinese-medicine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 09:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>/blog/what-is-traditional-chinese-medicine/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a history of thousands of years. It is a summary of long-term experience in fighting disease and an integral part of traditional Chinese culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCM studies human physiology and pathology, along with diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its theoretical system is influenced by Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory, guided by a holistic concept, based on internal organs and meridians, and characterized by syndrome differentiation and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
