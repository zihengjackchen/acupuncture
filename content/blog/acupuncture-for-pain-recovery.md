Pain can come from overuse, injury, poor sleep, stress, or long-standing inflammation. Acupuncture supports recovery by improving local circulation, reducing muscle tension, and helping regulate pain signaling.

It is commonly used for neck and back pain, sciatica, headaches, TMJ, tendon irritation, and pain after work, sports, or motor vehicle injuries.

## Common pain conditions treated

- Neck and back pain
- Sciatica
- Headaches and migraines
- Joint pain in shoulders, knees, and feet
- Tendon irritation such as tennis elbow and plantar fasciitis

## How long does it take to feel improvement?

Some patients feel relief quickly, especially with recent injuries. Chronic conditions often improve gradually over several weeks with consistent treatment.

## Tips to improve your results

1. Start care early when symptoms first appear.
2. Keep appointments consistent during the first phase of treatment.
3. Follow your practitioner's guidance on stretching, activity, and rest.

A personalized plan often combines symptom relief with prevention so pain is less likely to return.
