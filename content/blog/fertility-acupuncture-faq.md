## Is acupuncture a cure for infertility?

No. Acupuncture is not a cure for infertility, but it can be an effective part of a broader fertility care plan.

## How can acupuncture support fertility?

Depending on your case, acupuncture may help regulate menstrual cycles, improve blood flow to reproductive organs, reduce stress, and support hormone balance.

## Can acupuncture be used with IUI or IVF?

Yes. Many patients use acupuncture alongside assisted reproductive care. Timing and frequency are personalized based on your treatment calendar.

## Is acupuncture safe while trying to conceive or during pregnancy?

When performed by a licensed practitioner using sterile single-use needles, acupuncture is generally low risk. Treatment should always be individualized for your stage of care.

## How often should I come?

It depends on your goals and timeline. During active treatment, a common plan is 1-3 visits per week, then tapering as progress stabilizes.
