Acupuncture needles are hair-thin filiform needles. They are different from the hollow syringes used for injections or blood draws, and insertion is virtually painless for most people.

Points on the hands, feet, and face can occasionally be more sensitive, but this is usually brief.

During treatment, some people feel sensations such as soreness, numbness, bloating, heaviness, warmth, coolness, or even brief itching. These sensations are often temporary.

After needling, most people feel a deep sense of calm and relaxation. This is often when people notice the treatment beginning to work, and when acupuncture starts to heal.
