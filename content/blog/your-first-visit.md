Your first visit is focused on understanding the full picture of your health, not just one symptom. Expect a detailed conversation about your current concerns, medical history, sleep, digestion, stress, and lifestyle.

## Typical first-visit flow

1. Intake and health history review
2. TCM assessment, including pulse and tongue evaluation
3. Acupuncture treatment during the same visit
4. Home-care recommendations for the days after treatment

Most initial visits are about 90 minutes. Follow-up sessions are usually around 60 minutes.

## How to prepare

- Eat a light meal before your appointment.
- Wear loose, comfortable clothing.
- Bring a list of medications and supplements.
- Write down your main symptoms and questions.
- If fertility is your goal, bring cycle tracking information and any recent lab or treatment updates.

Most patients leave feeling calmer and more grounded after their first session.

## During fertility-focused visits

If you are trying to conceive naturally or using IUI/IVF, your care plan may be timed around your cycle and treatment milestones. Your acupuncturist can coordinate frequency recommendations with your broader medical care team.
