Acupuncture is one of the primary treatments under the Traditional Chinese Medicine umbrella, and it has a longer history than herbs. Its first written mention was around 100 BCE, and many scholars believe it was used several centuries earlier.

In Chinese medicine, health depends on the balance of yin and yang, qi (chee) and blood, and the functional harmony of organs and meridians. Imbalance is considered the root of disease.

Acupuncture uses hair-thin needles inserted at specific points on the body to help restore balance. When balance is restored, symptoms are relieved. The treatment is designed to help the body heal itself naturally and effectively.
