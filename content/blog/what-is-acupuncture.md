Acupuncture is a treatment method from Traditional Chinese Medicine that uses very thin, sterile needles placed at specific points on the body. The goal is to support the body's natural healing response and restore balance across different systems.

Many people first try acupuncture for pain, but it is also commonly used for stress, sleep issues, digestive symptoms, and women's health concerns.

## What happens in a standard session?

1. Brief check-in on current symptoms
2. Focused assessment based on your treatment goals
3. Needle placement at points selected for your condition
4. Rest period, usually 20-30 minutes
5. Follow-up recommendations before your next visit

## What does treatment feel like?

Most patients feel minimal discomfort when needles are inserted. During treatment, people often report a deep sense of relaxation, warmth, or heaviness in the treated area.

## Is acupuncture safe?

When provided by a licensed practitioner using sterile single-use needles, acupuncture is generally considered safe. Your provider should review your medical history and adjust care to your needs.

## How many sessions do I need?

It depends on your condition, duration of symptoms, and goals. Acute issues may improve quickly, while chronic concerns often need a structured series of visits followed by maintenance care.

For fertility support and complex chronic conditions, your practitioner may recommend multiple visits per week at first, then taper frequency as your condition improves.
