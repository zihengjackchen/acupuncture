Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a history of thousands of years. It is a summary of long-term experience in fighting disease and an integral part of traditional Chinese culture.

TCM studies human physiology and pathology, along with diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.

Its theoretical system is influenced by Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory, guided by a holistic concept, based on internal organs and meridians, and characterized by syndrome differentiation and treatment.

It has a unique theoretical system and rich clinical experience developed over centuries of practice.
