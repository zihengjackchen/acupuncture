# Acupuncture services tailored to your needs

Every treatment plan is personalized after a full consultation. Browse the categories below to see the conditions we commonly treat and how acupuncture can support your recovery and long-term health.

Most patients begin with a comprehensive first visit and then continue with regular follow-ups based on their goals and symptom pattern. For many conditions, especially fertility and chronic pain, we typically recommend a consistent treatment phase before shifting to maintenance care.

## What your care plan includes

1. Initial consultation (about 90 minutes): full health history, pulse and tongue assessment, first acupuncture treatment, and a clear plan.
2. Follow-up visits (about 60 minutes): symptom check-in, treatment updates, and optional add-on modalities when appropriate.
3. Ongoing guidance: lifestyle, sleep, stress, and nutrition support aligned with your goals.

## Common treatment goals

- Reduce pain and inflammation
- Improve menstrual regularity and fertility outcomes
- Improve sleep quality and daytime energy
- Reduce stress and anxiety symptoms
- Support whole-body balance during major life stages
