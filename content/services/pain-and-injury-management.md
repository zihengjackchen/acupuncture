Acupuncture can reduce pain, improve mobility, and support tissue healing. We treat both recent injuries and long-standing pain conditions with treatment plans adapted to your symptoms and activity level.

## Common pain conditions

- Neck pain
- Back pain and sciatica
- Bulging discs and spinal stenosis
- Migraines and headaches
- TMJ and facial pain
- Shoulder, elbow, and wrist pain
- Hip, knee, ankle, and foot pain
- Tendonitis, bursitis, and arthritis
- Tennis elbow and golf elbow
- Finger pain and trigger finger
- Plantar fasciitis
- Fibromyalgia

## How acupuncture supports pain recovery

- Helps regulate pain signaling pathways
- Improves local blood flow to injured tissues
- Reduces muscle guarding and stiffness
- Supports nervous system down-regulation to improve recovery

## Injury support

- Work-related injuries
- Sports injuries
- Motor vehicle accident recovery

## Treatment plan expectations

Pain plans are customized by severity and duration. Acute injuries may improve in fewer sessions, while chronic pain often requires a structured series of visits with home-care support between appointments.
