Recurring respiratory, immune, and skin symptoms can be exhausting. We use acupuncture to help calm flare-ups, reduce symptom frequency, and support resilience over time.

## Common concerns we treat

- Allergy, asthma, and sinus syndrome
- Acute and chronic cough
- Bronchitis support
- Sinusitis support
- Acne
- Bell's palsy

## What to expect

- Symptom-focused treatment during active flare-ups
- Follow-up care to improve stability between episodes
- Practical guidance for seasonal and lifestyle triggers
