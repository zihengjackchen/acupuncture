Every new patient begins with a full consultation, including health history, symptom review, and treatment planning. We use this first visit to understand root causes and design care that supports both short-term relief and long-term balance.

## Initial consultation (90 minutes)

- Traditional Chinese Medicine intake and diagnosis
- Review of your medical history and current treatment goals
- Pulse and tongue assessment
- First acupuncture treatment during the same visit
- Personalized acupuncture treatment plan
- Lifestyle and self-care recommendations

## Follow-up sessions (60 minutes)

Follow-up visits include progress check-ins and treatment adjustments based on changes in your physical and emotional health. Your practitioner may also revise herbal support and recommend additional modalities when appropriate.

## Optional integrative add-ons

- Cupping
- Moxabustion
- Gentle massage techniques
- Red light therapy add-on
- Herbal recommendations when clinically appropriate

## Typical treatment frequency

While every plan is personalized, many patients begin with 1-3 visits per week during the active treatment phase before moving to a lower maintenance frequency.

## Current clinic rates and coverage

- Initial consultation (90 minutes): $160
- Follow-up visit (60 minutes): $100
- Red light add-on: $35

Insurance coverage for acupuncture varies by policy. We can help you verify benefits before treatment.
