We provide gentle, personalized care for hormonal and reproductive health at every stage of life. Treatment plans are created around your cycle, symptoms, and broader health picture.

## How acupuncture can support fertility

Acupuncture is not a cure for infertility, but it can be a meaningful part of an integrative fertility plan. Depending on your diagnosis and care plan, acupuncture may help:

- Improve blood flow to reproductive organs
- Support hormone regulation
- Regulate menstruation and ovulation patterns
- Lower stress related to trying to conceive
- Reduce inflammatory burden
- Support egg, embryo, and sperm quality
- Complement IUI and IVF timelines

## Women's conditions we commonly treat

- Infertility
- Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)
- Menstrual disorders and cycle irregularity
- Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
- Painful menses and endometriosis support
- Menopausal syndrome
- Pelvic pain
- Postpartum recovery

## Session structure for fertility-focused care

- Initial consultation: detailed history, pulse and tongue assessment, and first treatment
- Follow-up sessions: treatment progression based on cycle timing and symptom updates
- Integrative options: herbs, nutrition referral, and mind-body support as needed

## Important safety note

Always coordinate supplements and fertility treatment decisions with your physician or registered dietitian, especially during IUI, IVF, or pregnancy.
