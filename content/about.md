## Founded in 2022

Harmony Acupuncture Clinic was founded in 2022 to bring thoughtful, patient-centered Traditional Chinese Medicine care to the western suburbs of Chicago. From day one, the clinic has focused on listening deeply to each patient and building treatment plans that fit real life.

We support patients with acute and chronic pain, women's health concerns, fertility goals, stress and sleep disorders, and whole-body wellness care. Each visit is designed to restore balance physically and emotionally.

## Our approach

At each appointment we review the whole picture of your health, including physical symptoms, mental and emotional stressors, and lifestyle patterns that may affect recovery.

- Individualized treatment based on your goals and symptoms
- TCM assessment methods such as pulse and tongue evaluation
- Evidence-informed recommendations for acupuncture frequency
- Integrative care options when appropriate, including herbs, cupping, moxabustion, and nutrition support referrals

## Safety first

Acupuncture is generally low risk when performed by a licensed practitioner using sterile, single-use needles. It can be used alongside medical care and is not a replacement for emergency treatment.
