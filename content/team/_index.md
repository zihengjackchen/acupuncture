# About harmonyhealthclinic

harmonyhealthclinic is led by Dr. Dan Wang, a licensed acupuncturist and herbalist with deep training in Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Traditional Chinese Medicine has a history of thousands of years. It summarizes long-term clinical experience in preventing and treating disease and remains an important part of traditional Chinese culture.

Its theory is influenced by Yin-Yang and Five Elements principles, guided by a holistic concept, grounded in internal organs and meridians, and characterized by syndrome differentiation and treatment.
